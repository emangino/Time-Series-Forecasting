Using R to forecast hotel occupancy overtime

# Project Summary
This project was submitted as a final in my masters program. Our promt was to find a research to find a data set that could be used in an industry that we would be going into. I was consulting with another hospitaly company at the time so I chose hotel occupancy. 

There are two documents a part of this repository. One is the R code and the other is the project that was submitted to explain the findings.
